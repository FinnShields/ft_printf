# ft_printf
ft_printf project from Hive Helsinki

The project aims to replicate the basic functionality of C's native function printf.
Eseentially, it prints each character of the given string, and upon encountering a '%' symbol it applies the next character to the function 'execute'
which takes incorporates the next member of the va_list into the output.

This project enabled me to learn about variadic functions in C.
